# Discord-Bot

A thank you to www.freecodecamp.org and www.realpython.com for guiding this project

This bot is coded in Python, in case you did not grasp that when looking at the file names. This project will be continuously worked on until I become bored with it, however, it will be general basics that are easy to understand. The installation section will tell you what you need in order for this to work. Cool? Cool.
